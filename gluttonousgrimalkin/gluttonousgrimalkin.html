                      The Gluttonous Grimalkin is a top-down action game built for Android in which players control an enchanted cat and run around dwarven city environments, eating dwarves, breaking trebuchets, and growing bigger. The game features three enemy types and two environmental hazards. As the cat grows larger, it gains the ability to eat formerly-dangerous enemies, until, at its largest size, the cat can rampage around each level without fear.

                      I was the lead game programmer for the project. During development I was responsible and accountable for technical and production tasks, consulted on matters of game and level design and informed about visual tasks. I collaborated with another programmer, two level designers and an artist over the course of a semester to design and build the game using Unity. I spent the majority of my time designing and building the movement system, GUIs, an outline shader for our enemies, and lower level systems such as loading screens and saving player progress.

                  <h2 class="my-4">What Went Well</h2>
                  <p>
                      I improved my task time estimation skills as the project progressed and was able to make accurate time estimates for tasks most of the time by the final milestones.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I got more comfortable interacting with LDs and artists and learned how to see the project from their point of view, which allowed me to prioritize my own tasks more effectively.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I was able to use my prior perforce knowledge to help fix any issues we ran into as a team.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      I had a good sense of which features would be important for the game. For instance, adding the outline around enemies was time consuming but really helped conveyance, so I think it was worth it.
                  </p>
                  <h2 class="my-4">What Went Wrong</h2>
                  <p>
                      I didn’t always communicate perforce practices well enough which led to some conflicts and lost work that could have been avoided.
                  <p>
                      Earlier on in the project I voiced my frustrations with tasks more openly, which could bring down the mood in the studio.
                  <p>
                      I went too deep into my own work sometimes and forgot about the rest of the team. I had some larger tasks that could block the LDs that I could’ve submitted checkpoints for as I was working, but by keeping everything until the end the LDs couldn’t move forward.
                  </p>
                  <h2 class="my-4">What I Learned</h2>
                  <p>
                      I learned how to break tasks into more specific sub tasks as the project progressed. Early on, I had a lot of long, vague tasks that were hard to estimate. Smaller tasks can be estimated more easily and it’s easier to tell if a particular sub task is taking too long.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      The morale of the studio is really important, so it’s important to be mindful that you’re not spouting negativity that could damage morale.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Along with breaking large tasks into smaller ones, it’s important to submit checkpoints as you work on a larger feature. If you can at least give the LDs a rough version of a feature, then they can start planning around it while waiting for the final version to be completed.
                  </p>
                  <h1 class="my-4">Team</h1>
                  <h2 class="my-4">What Went Well</h2>
                  <p>
                      We did a good job of maintaining communication throughout the project. Whenever someone had a question or ran into a problem they would talk to the group and we could quickly resolve the issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We handled feedback well and used the playtests as an opportunity to discuss our game and how to improve it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We all worked towards a shared vision for the game and pitched in on the necessary tasks to finish the work. We also added extra polish as we worked that really made the game feel more complete.
                  </p>
                  <h2 class="my-4">What Went Wrong</h2>
                  <p>
                      We had trouble abiding by our own asset locks and would try to sneak in last minute changes very late into each milestone. This led to stressful days on the last day of milestones as we rushed to integrate all the changes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We forgot to utilize our stakeholder enough early on in the project. We could have gotten valuable feedback before POCG and VS if we would’ve showed our work to the stakeholder sooner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      There were some tasks that we weren’t experienced enough to estimate correctly and caused us more problems than anticipated. For instance, with the aesthetic passes for each level we didn’t know that would cause so many ripple effects in the game and would have addressed that earlier if we had known. More experience will help with situations like this.
                  </p>
                  <h2 class="my-4">What I Learned</h2>
                  <p>
                      Communication is critical to working effectively on a team game project. If the team doesn’t know what you’re working on or if you don’t understand the ramifications of a change, there can be problems.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Not every cut idea is a bad one, it might just not fit the game. We initially planed for a fancy spawning system that would continuously spawn enemies for the player to eat, but as we progressed it was clear that smaller, more controllable levels would provide a better experience, so we cut the spawner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      We learned to spend more time considering the ramifications of a change to the game before making it. We had some features that broke others, so ass the project progressed we became much more proactive about talking with the team before implementing a new feature to make sure there would be no surprises.
