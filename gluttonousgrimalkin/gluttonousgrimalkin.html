                      The Gluttonous Grimalkin is a top-down action game built for Android in which players control an enchanted cat and run around dwarven city environments, eating dwarves, breaking trebuchets, and growing bigger. The game features three enemy types and two environmental hazards. As the cat grows larger, it gains the ability to eat formerly-dangerous enemies, until, at its largest size, the cat can rampage around each level without fear.

                      I was the lead game programmer for the project. During development I was responsible and accountable for technical and production tasks, consulted on matters of game and level design and informed about visual tasks. I collaborated with another programmer, two level designers and an artist over the course of a semester to design and build the game using Unity. I spent the majority of my time designing and building the movement system, GUIs, an outline shader for our enemies, and lower level systems such as loading screens and saving player progress.

                      Building the movement system was one of the most challenging parts of this project. We initially wanted to have a swipe to move system so the player would need to quickly swipe while playing to keep up the excitement. After much playtesting we discovered that swiping was very tedious so I changed the movement to a more straightforward tap and hold design. This turned out to be pretty simple to implement and was a great example of how playtesting is vital to find out how others want to play the game and how best to accommodate those playstyles.

                      In order to better convey to the player which enemies could and couldn't be eaten, I added a shader to outline edible enemies in green and dangerous enemies in red. By checking for pixels that were entirely transparent up to 7 pixels away, I tinted the outer 7 pixels of each enemy sprite the appropriate color. We actually ran into some performance issues when multiple trebuchets were on screen since those sprites were so complex, so I optimized the shader by exiting early if no transparent pixels could be found within a distance of 8, speeding up our rendering considerably and improving the frame rate when trebuchets were on screen.

                      I built the infrastructure for our enemies to communicate with the player whenever a collision occurred. After colliding, the player will check what kind of enemy was touched and compare their size classes to see whether the enemy should be eaten or the player should take damage. The player's code will then tell the enemy to die if eaten allowing the enemies to handle that however they want. For instance, when a trebuchet is destroyed it will spawn a group of 30 dwarves who quickly flee from the player. I also wrote the logic for trebuchet attacking. The trebuchets check a vision range in front of them and raytrace to the player to see if the trebuchet has a clear line of sight before firing.

                      After each level is completed, the player's high score and number of dwarves earned is persisted in player prefs. This data is displayed in the level select menu beneath the label for each level. Levels are locked until a bronze dwarf is achieved and a special perfect state can be earned by eating all dwarves in a level. I also added the ability to clear your progress from the level select menu.
