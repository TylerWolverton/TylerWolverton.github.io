    	    20,000 Leagues Over the Sea is a collaboration between SIGGD and GDU (Game Developer's United). Drawing from a wonderful mix between the earlier classics of Missile Defense and Asteroids,
			20,000 Leagues Over the Sea revolves around using orbital mechanics to defend a planet from invading aliens. The game was developed with the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity Game Engine</a>, 
			presented in a top-down 2.5D perspective. 
    	</p>

			I was the president of SIGGD and lead game programmer for this project. I spent the majority of my time managing both the programmers and artists throughout the development cycle. I also took care
			of administration tasks such as presentations to corporate partners and other students as well as onboarding new members into SIGGD. I was in charge of importing models and textures created by the artists
			into the game. I also wrote core gameplay systems like player respawning, planet health and random planet and background generation.

		<p>20,000 Leagues Over the Sea was entered into the 2015 Student Independent Games Festival.</p>
