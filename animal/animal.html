        	Animal Armies was developed using our in house engine, Mirror Engine, and the second version of our level editor, Treequake Level Editor. I was the technical lead and co creative director for the project.
			I worked with both the art and programming teams in SIGGD as well as another ACM club SIGART (Special Interest Group Artificial Intelligence) to create a coherent game with both local multiplayer and computer 
			controlled opponents. We wanted to bring a roguelike feel to the turn-based strategy genre, so each team is comprised of a random assortment of units each with different stats and the world terrain is randomly 
			generated for each match. My main technical contribution to the project was the development of core gameplay systems such as how turns are structured and units are moved as well as the GUIs used throughout the game.
