    	    Flashlight Tag 2D is the classic game of flashlight tag recreated in a custom engine built with SDL2. The project gives me the opportunity
			to deepen my understanding of game development by designing and implementing the engine used to run the game alongside the game itself. I chose an
			entity component design for my engine which allows for increased modularity and flexibility while building game entities. I will also
			use OpenGl and shaders to create a lighting system that will be able to replicate flashlight beams in the game. I currently have the core game loop, input, 
			basic camera logic, and simple physics completed and I'm working on converting the rendering process from SDL2's helper functions to raw OpenGl in order
			to write my own custom shaders.
