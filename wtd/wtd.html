        <p>
        	Within the Darkness was developed using an in house engine and level editor, Mirror Engine and Oceanland Level Editor respectively. I was the lead game programmer for the project
        	and was responsible for managing a group of about 5 other game programmers. I coordinated with the lead of the engine and level editor teams to make sure we had the features needed
			to complete the game. 
		</p>
		<p>
			My main contribution to the project was the development of enemies and player attacks. I worked with designers to develop and iterate on the player's magic attacks and the explosive
			sword special attack, as well as the Octo, Disco Blob, Sentinel, and Spikon enemies. I had the opportunity to design and implement the first boss encountered in the game, Mr. Hammer.
			With explosive melee and magic stun attacks, Mr. Hammer is one of the most dangerous enemies lurking in the dungeon.
