        <p class="date">Summer 2015 - Present</p>
        <p>
            In order to gain a better understanding of game development, I created an engine using SDL 2.0 and C++. I plan to use the engine to make a game soon.

	As a student at Purdue University I was the lead game programmer and later president of the student club, 
	ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) SIGGD (Special Interest Group in Game Development). SIGGD averaged
	about 15 members during each of the three years I participated in the club and we developed one game each year.

            Drawing from a wonderful mix between the earlier classics of Missile Defense and Asteroids,
            20,000 Leagues Over the Sea revolves around using orbital mechanics to defend a planet from invading aliens.

            Turn based strategy game involving packs of animals fighting for survival on a battlefield of randomly generated terrain. 
            Built on our Mirror Engine, Animal Armies shows that the engine can be adapted from a game of adventure to a game of turn based strategy.
