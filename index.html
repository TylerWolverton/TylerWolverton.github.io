            In order to gain a better understanding of game development, I created an engine using SDL 2.0 and C++. I plan to use the engine to make a game soon.

		As a student at Purdue University I was the lead game programmer and later president of the student club, 
		ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) SIGGD (Special Interest Group in Game Development). SIGGD averaged
		about 15 members during each of the three years I participated in the club and we developed one game each year.
