		Hey, I'm Tyler Wolverton, a software engineer and game programmer. I've had an interest in video games and game development for most of my life.
		I had the opportunity to work with a student club to make games while pursuing a computer science degree at Purdue University. After graduating in 2014, I've 
		been working as a software engineer at Genesys for the past 3 years as well as working on game projects in my spare time. 
	</p>
	<p>
		While at Purdue, I was the lead game programmer and later president of an ACM special interest group for game development SIGGD (Special Interest Group Game Development).
		I loved the blend of design and engineering that went into working as a game programmer in the group. I contributed to 3 games during my 3 years as a part of the club and
		was able to progressively take on more responsibility and leadership each year. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm currently working on a flashlight tag game in SDL2 and OpenGL. Since most of my experience is related to game programming, working on a game engine alongside
		the game has taught me a lot about the entire game development process.

		Feel free to check out some of my work and thanks for visiting!
