            Hey, I'm Tyler Wolverton, a software engineer and game programmer. I've had an interest in video games and game development for most of my life.
            I had the opportunity to work with a student club to make games while pursuing a computer science degree at Purdue University. After graduating in 2014, I
            worked as a software engineer at Genesys for the next 5 years while continuing to work on game projects in my spare time. I'm currently attending SMU Guildhall
            pursuing a Software Engineering Master's Degree focusing on game development.
        </p>
        <p>
            While at Purdue, I was the lead game programmer and later president of ACM SIGGD (Special Interest Group Game Development).
            I loved the blend of design and engineering that went into working as a game programmer in the group. I contributed to 3 games during my 3 years as a part of the club and
            was able to progressively take on more responsibility and leadership each year.
        </p>
        <p>
            My biggest personal project was an action RPG built in my own engine written with SDL2 and OpenGL. Since most of my experience had been related to game programming, working on a game engine alongside
            the game taught me a lot about the entire game development process.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm currently working through the curriculum at SMU Guildhall, a blend of team game projects and solo software development. In my first semester I collaborated with 4 other students to make an Android game, 
            The Gluttonous Grimalkin, using Unity. In my software development courses we built the beginnings of our own 2D game engine by creating 3 small games during the semester, each with more complicated game systems 
            and technology. I've learned an enormous amount so far and I can't wait to continue learning everything I can about game development!
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to check out some of my work and thanks for visiting!
        </p>
